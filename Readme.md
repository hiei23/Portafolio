## CSC404 - Winter 2017 - Game Design Project 

Cat's cradle

**Story** 

In a desperate attempt to make them behave, an impatient cat owner has tied their two cats together with a string. But the cats are having none of this, and are hell-bent on retrieving their favourite snacks and destroying as much of their owner’s home as possible in the process.

**Goals**

Cat’s Cradle is a two-player cooperative/competitive game. Players must work together to find fish (cat treats) and destroy as much as possible in a set time limit.

## CSC302 Winter 2016 project - TA Assignment Prototype ##

Technology used: ** Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, Redux, Rust**

this project was created to help the departmental Teaching Assistant coordinator, is the faculty member who ultimately signs the contract offer letter for each TA we hire. 
The ta-coord chooses which of the applicants we hire and which course they will be assigned to. 
In a typical fall or winter session the ta-coordinator will make about 350 assignments. (This is a very time consuming project, between one and two person weeks of effort.) 
Any UI and/or search and/or filtering workflow innovations that have potential to save labour are worth evaluating.

**Features**:

* Filters applicants by education level, experience and program.
* Filters courses by undergraduate and graduate type.
* Assign TA by right cliking an applicant
